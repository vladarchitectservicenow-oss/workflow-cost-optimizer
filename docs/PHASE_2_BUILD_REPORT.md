## 4. GitHub Push Verification

Repository URL: `https://github.com/vladarchitectservicenow-oss/workflow-cost-optimizer`

Remote: Verified via `git ls-remote` and `git push` confirmation.
Commits: Initial build, test fixes, documentation expansion, phase report addition.

## 5. Known Limitations

- v1.0.0 covers Zurich-to-Australia deprecation rules. Future releases will add Washington DC preview rules.
- AI-assisted remediation hints require AI Agent Studio activation on the target instance.
- PDF report generation uses HTML-to-PDF transformation; very large instances may require report segmentation.

## 6. Next Steps

1. Install on PDI for smoke testing by stakeholders.
2. Gather feedback from early adopters.
3. Plan v1.1.0 with AI Agent Studio integration and Washington DC preview support.
4. Publish to the ServiceNow Store if demand justifies investment.
